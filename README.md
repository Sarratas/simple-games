# About
This repository contains pretty simple typescript, object oriented implementations of popular 2d games. The goal is to keep each game standalone, serverless and if possible - independent from third-party npm packages.

## List of games implemented
- pong
- snake

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Sarratas/simple-games.git`  
`npm install`

# Run locally
To run the game locally you will need:
- typescript - to compile into javascript, can be installed either locally or globally - 
- http-server - to serve compiled files to the browser
- eslint and plugins - nice to have, to lint your code
All of those will get installed with `npm install`

To compile source code:
`npm run compile`

To run web server:
`npm run start`

To check the code with eslint:
`npm run lint`
